In order to rebuild RustClient:

- Edit the "src\main.rs" file if required.

- Download and install "Rust" from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. 
  Use the recommended "rustup". Select the 64-bit installer.

  It should include the Rust compiler and Cargo package manager. 
  To check, run from command line:

  	rustc --version
  	cargo --version

- Run this command:

	cargo build --release

  It will generate "target\release\RustClient.exe"

- Rebuild ("Rebuild All") the main Visual Studio solution. A Custom build step 
  will copy 'RustClient.exe' to output folder as 'RustClient.bin'.

- Commit and push the changes to Git (including 'RustClient.exe').
