In order to rebuild DClient:

- Download and install 'DMD' compiler for Windows from https://dlang.org/download.html.

- Run 'build.cmd'. It will make the 'DClient.exe' file. 

- Rebuild ("Rebuild All") the main Visual Studio solution. A Custom build step 
  will copy 'DClient.exe' to output folder as 'DClient.bin'.

- Commit and push the changes to Git (including 'DClient.exe').
