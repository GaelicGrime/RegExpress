Integrating standard <regex>
----------------------------

Recalled steps:

- Add '#include <regex>' to pch.h.

- Use the classes.


-----------------------
Integrating Boost.Regex 
-----------------------

Recalled steps:

- Download Boost, Version 1.72.0 (https://www.boost.org/), unarchive.

- In project folder, create "boost_1_72_0_min" subfolder.

- Copy "<downloaded Boost>\boost" into "boost_1_72_0_min\boost", without subfolders.

- Copy "<downloaded Boost>\libs\regex\src" into "boost_1_72_0_min\libs\regex\src".

- In Visual Studio, create a filter: "Boost", and add all files from "boost_1_72_0_min\libs\regex\src".

- In Properties for these files only, set: "Forced Include File: pch.h". Keep "Precompiled Header: Use".

- In "pch.h", add this:

	//#define BOOST_REGEX_DYN_LINK
	#define BOOST_REGEX_NO_LIB
	//#define BOOST_REGEX_NO_FASTCALL

	#define BOOST_REGEX_WIDE_INSTANTIATE
	#define BOOST_REGEX_NARROW_INSTANTIATE

	#define BOOST_REGEX_MATCH_EXTRA // for captures

	#include "boost/regex.hpp"

- In Project Properties, for all configurations, in VC++ Directories, Include Directories, add this:

	$(ProjectDir)boost_1_72_0_min 
	
Quotation marks were not needed.
 
- Try compiling. A series of missing boost .h files are reported. Add the required ones. The following 
minimal set of subfilders were copied from "<downloaded Boost>\boost" to "boost_1_72_0_min\boost":

	config
	container_hash
	core
	detail
	exception
	integer
	mpl
	predef
	preprocessor
	regex -- already there
	smart_ptr
	type_traits
	utility

- Use the classes.


-----------------------
Integrating PCRE2
-----------------------

Recalled steps:


- Download from http://www.pcre.org/ ("pcre2-10.34.tar.gz" from https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/).

- Create a project's subfolder on disk: "PCRE2". In Visual Studio, create new filter: "PCRE2".
Use them for PCRE files.

Note that some of source files, such as "pcre2_jit_match.c", "pcre2_jit_misc.c" should be copied, 
but not included into build. (They are included using #include).

- Follow the steps from "NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD" file of PCRE.

		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32580066/using-pcre2-in-a-c-project
		https://github.com/ltrzesniewski/pcre-net

- Add to "pch.h" (instead of defining in Project Properties):

	#define HAVE_CONFIG_H

Also add:
	#include "PCRE2.h"

To support JIT:

	#define SUPPORT_JIT 1

But also use the files from "src\sljit".


- In Project Properties, for all configurations, in VC++ Directories, Include Directories, add this:

	$(ProjectDir)PCRE2 

Quotation marks were not needed.

- Create "pch-c.h" and "pch-c.c" and arrange creating the second Precompiled Header (with separate output name).
Make sure "pch-c.c" is compiled as C without "/clr".
 
- In Properties for PCRE2 .c files only, set: "Forced Include File: pch-c.h". Keep "Precompiled Header: Use".
Also set "Compile as C++ (/TP)". Also remove "/clr" option.
